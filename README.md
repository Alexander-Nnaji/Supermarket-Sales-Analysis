# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis


### Project Overview

This analysis explores key metrics across branches, product lines, and customer demographics to uncover insights driving revenue and profit. It identifies the top-performing branch and product line, reveals sales trends over time, and evaluates purchase behavior by customer type and gender. Additionally, it highlights peak revenue days and the product lines with the highest profit margins, enabling data-driven decisions for sales optimization and targeted marketing strategies.

 ### Key Insight/ Findings

These insights and findings directly align with the objectives of the project and address the core business problem

- Branch C generated the highest revenue, totaling ₦110,568.71.
   Key Insight: Branch C outperforms other locations in sales, indicating strong customer traffic or higher transaction volumes. It should be prioritized for resource allocation, promotions, or expansion strategy


- The Food and Beverages product line contributed the most to total saleswith a total of 56,144.84
     Key Insight: Food and Beverages is a top-performing category, suggesting consistent customer demand. Marketing efforts and inventory planning should be aligned to support this segment.


 - Our analysis focused on a three-month period (Q1), covering January, February, and March. During this quarter, total sales were as follows:

   January: ₦116,291.87

   February: ₦97,219.27

  March: ₦109,455.51

 Key Insight:
January recorded the highest sales, followed by March, while February experienced the lowest performance. This trend suggests strong sales momentum at the beginning of the year, with a slight dip in February and a recovery in March. The January spike may reflect post-holiday or new-year buying patterns, indicating a potential opportunity to plan future promotions during this period to sustain high sales.

 
- Member(164,223.44) customers account for a higher share of total sales compared to non-members(158,743.31)
 Key Insight: Loyalty members contribute more consistently to revenue, validating the impact of the membership program. Consider strategies to increase membership sign-ups.


- Fashion accesories(17.8) products recorded the highest profit margins.
  Key Insight: These high-margin product lines are strategic profit drivers. Focused marketing or bundling strategies can improve profit performance further.


- Our analysis shows that Thursday consistently generated the highest total revenue among all days of the week.

 Key Insight:
Thursday appears to be a peak sales day, which may indicate a common shopping pattern ahead of weekends. This insight presents an opportunity to optimize in-store operations, staffing, and targeted promotions on Thursdays to further capitalize on high customer activity and maximize revenue.


 Female & members consistently contributed the highest to total sales.
     Key Insight: Female & members are the most valuable customer segment. Personalized engagement and reward programs could boost retention and sales.


  ### Recommendation

  Strengthen Operations and Promotions at Branch C
    Allocate more resources (inventory, staff, marketing) to Branch C to build on its strong performance and further maximize revenue.

   Leverage High-Margin Product Lines
    Promote and prioritize high-margin categories such as Health & Beauty and Home & Lifestyle through bundling strategies and targeted discounts to boost overall profitability.

   Capitalize on Peak Sales Days (Thursday & Weekends)
    Optimize staffing, stock levels, and marketing offers ahead of Thursdays and weekends, when customer traffic is highest.

   Focus on Member Engagement
    Increase customer acquisition efforts for the membership program, as members tend to spend more. Consider introducing tiered rewards or exclusive deals to enhance retention.

   Reinforce January Marketing Strategy
    Given that January recorded the highest sales, plan early-year promotional campaigns and stock adjustments to capitalize on new-year shopping behavior.

  Target High-Spending Customer Segments
    Use personalized offers and campaigns to target female shoppers, particularly loyal members, who contribute more per transaction on average.

   Monitor and Improve February Sales Dip
    Investigate the drop in February sales and identify potential causes (e.g., post-holiday slowdown, pricing issues), and plan targeted interventions to avoid repeated dips in future quarters.
